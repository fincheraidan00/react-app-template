# react-app-template
This is a basic template for a Node.js app using the React front end framework.
I made this template due to issues I had with the excessive amount of boilerplate generated by create-react-app. This is a stripped down version of that same build system.

## Installation
Use git CLI to clone template to new project directory:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/fincheraidan00/react-app-template [DEST_FOLDER]
```

Make sure to change project name to [DEST_FOLDER] in package.json file.
Run yarn install to install all node_module files

This template includes ESLint by default. ESLint must be initialized before use. 
```bash
yarn run eslint --init
```
