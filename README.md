# react-app-template
This is a basic template for a Node.js app using the React front end framework.
I made this template due to issues I had with the excessive amount of boilerplate generated by create-react-app. This is a stripped down version of that same build system.

## Installation
Use git CLI to clone template to new project directory:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/fincheraidan00/react-app-template [DEST_FOLDER]
```

Make sure to change project name to [DEST_FOLDER] in package.json file.
Run yarn install to install all node_module files

This template includes ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. 
My .eslintrc and .prettierrc files are included. Feel free to make your own changes to match your personal coding style
